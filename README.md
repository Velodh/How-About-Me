# Velodh

Hi Everyone 👋

• My name is Velodh, I'm French and I'm becoming the new Pirate King haha (don't worry I'm joking 😁). I'm specialized on Computer Sciences and I would become a great Web Developer. I love Video-Games and Computer since I was Kid ! So I would like someone to give me the chance to work in this exciting profession.

• 🍗 I am 17 years old.

• 💻 I work on a wide variety of projects, from website creation to games, both in and out of school.

• 👾 I'm currently learning React, Node.js, and would like to deepen my skills in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and HTML/CSS to complete large projects.

• 👯 I'd like to meet competent developers who can help me deepen my knowledge and with whom I can collaborate by sharing our experiences.

• 🤖 How to reach me ? It's simple : LinkedIn = https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnaud-muller-956aa8265/ | Discord = Velodh#3137
